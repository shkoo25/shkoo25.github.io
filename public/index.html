                        <p>My name is Steve Koo and I am a  recent graduatue from The Iron Yard.  The Iron Yard is a 3 month intensive developing bootcamp where I learned Front End Engineering skills.  How I came to The Iron Yard was solely based on recognizing that I needed a career change.  I graduated from Radford University with a Bachelors in Business Administration and gained remarkable public speaking and consulting skills.  My previous employments were great, but it wasn't what I was passionate about.  Helping others find a want and need is what I'm passionate about.  Creativity, dedication, and helping others is what I want to do and what better way to do so then making interactive websites that I could be proud of and so can other users.</br>

                      </br>
                      Besides coding, I consider myself an outdoorsman.  I enjoy playing golf, excercising, pools/beaches, fishing, and snowboarding.  I'm currently a rookie blogger and slowly but surely work my way to become a novice one.  Currently I'm looking forward to working contract to hire or a full time developer.</p>
